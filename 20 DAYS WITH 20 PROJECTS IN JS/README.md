# 20 DAYS WITH 20 PROJECTS IN JS

This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript by building **20 projects in 20 days**. The projects were created as part of a course I followed on Udemy. Each project demonstrates a practical implementation of JavaScript concepts and techniques.

## Overview
This repository is more than just codeâ€”it's a hands-on adventure into web development. Each project is carefully crafted to apply and reinforce key concepts of *`HTML`*, *`CSS`*, and *`JavaScript`*, ensuring a practical learning experience.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my *`JavaScript`* skills by applying them to real-world projects. It also serves as a portfolio to showcase my learning and progress.
